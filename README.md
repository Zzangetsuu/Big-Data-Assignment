Great, let's break down what you need to do next:

Define Spark Topology: In the rankDocuments method, you'll need to define the Spark topology to process the queries and news articles according to the task description. This includes the text pre-processing, scoring with the DPH model, ranking documents for each query, and removing redundancy.

Text Pre-processing: Utilize the provided text pre-processor function to tokenize, remove stopwords, and stem the text of both the documents and queries. You can use Spark transformations to apply this pre-processing to the text data.

Scoring with DPH Model: Implement the DPH scoring function provided in the task description. This function calculates a score for each document-term pair based on various statistics. You'll need to calculate these statistics efficiently using Spark transformations.

Ranking Documents: Once you have the DPH scores calculated for each document-query pair, rank the documents for each query based on their relevance scores. Ensure that you return the top 10 documents for each query as output.

Removing Redundancy: Analyze the ranking of documents for each query to identify and remove any redundant or near-duplicate documents. Use the provided string distance function to calculate the textual distance between document titles. If the distance is less than 0.5, keep only the most relevant document based on the DPH score.

Return Results: Instead of returning null at the end of the rankDocuments method, return the list of DocumentRanking objects generated by your topology.

Testing: Test your Spark application locally using the provided data files or sample data. Ensure that it produces the expected output and meets the requirements specified in the task description.

Optimization: As you develop your Spark topology, focus on optimizing its performance in terms of processing speed and resource utilization. Use Spark transformations and actions efficiently to minimize overhead and improve scalability.

Documentation: Document your code thoroughly, including comments to explain the logic and functionality of each part of the Spark topology.

Submission: Once you have completed the development and testing of your Spark application, submit your code along with any necessary documentation or reports for evaluation.
